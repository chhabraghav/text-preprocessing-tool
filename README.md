# 📝 Text Preprocessing Tool  


## 🚀 Overview  
This is a **custom-built text preprocessing tool** designed to analyze plain text documents and extract key statistics. It includes **sentence segmentation, word tokenization, punctuation handling, contraction expansion, and frequency analysis** while adhering to structured NLP preprocessing rules.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
- 📄 **Text Statistics:** Counts **paragraphs, sentences, tokens, and unique words**.  
- ✂️ **Custom Tokenization:** Follows specific rules to handle punctuation & contractions.  
- 📊 **Word Frequency Analysis:** Ranks words by usage frequency.  
- 📈 **Zipf’s Law Visualization:** Generates a log-log plot of word rank vs. frequency.

## 📊 Results  

### 🔹 Example Output Format  
📌 **Word frequency ranking (Top 5 most common words):**  

| Rank | Word  | Frequency |  
|------|------|------------|  
| 1️⃣  | the  | 50         |  
| 2️⃣  | and  | 40         |
